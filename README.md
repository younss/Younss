My name is Younss (Jonas), and I'm a Senior Solutions Architect Manager with a deep passion for Coding and Automation. With over 18 years of experience in Software Development, Systems Management, and DevOps Engineering, I've had the privilege to contribute to and deliver numerous projects leveraging open-source technologies. My journey has taken me from coding Java applications and three-tier architectures to developing micro-frontends using ReactJS, as well as mobile apps using Flutter and React Native. Additionally, I've designed and deployed MLOps pipelines using GitLab and Kubernetes, and I'm experienced in deploying Cloud Architecture on AWS.

I am inherently curious and always eager to learn new things. I find that constant learning keeps me energized and allows me to continuously deliver value. Give me a keyboard and a monitor, and I'll immerse myself in learning and delivering solutions. My Ikigai lies in collaborating and co-creating within a stellar team. While I don't claim to know everything, I'm always open to learning, even at my age.

My recent excitement lies in exploring AI technologies, particularly using Rust with LLM (Large Language Models).

I strongly believe in the power of open-source collaboration and find fulfillment in contributing to projects that positively impact the community.

Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories. If you have any questions or would like to connect, please don't hesitate to reach out!
